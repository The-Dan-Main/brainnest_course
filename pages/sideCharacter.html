                <ul>
                    <li>
                        His parents, a pair of famous aurors, were in the order of the phoenix and got tortured into
                        insanity by <em>Belatrix Lestrange</em>,
                        when neville was one year old. He was then raised by his grandmother 'Augusta Longbottom'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        His parents live now in at <em>St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries</em>, as
                        they are
                        mentally damaged from their torture.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Lord Voldemort</em> decided by himself, after hearing the prophecy, that the little
                        <em>Harry Potter</em> is the
                        chosen one,
                        even though the prophecy is not that specifically leading to the potters.
                        <br>
                        Harry and Neville, because of the prophecy, could have both been meant by it.
                        <em>Lord Voldemort</em>, however, made the decision that the Potters and not the Longbottoms
                        were meant.
                    </li>
                    <li>His grandmother believed that Neville was not a magician because he never showed any impulsive
                        magical actions as a young boy.
                        <br>
                        Neville's <em>Uncle Algie</em> tried to tease out his magical powers by hanging Neville out of a
                        window
                        when Neville's grandmother offered <em>Uncle Algie</em> a piece of lemon meringue.
                        <br>
                        Algee accidentally let go of Neville when he accepted the pie and Neville bounced around her
                        yard like a rubber ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although Neville expressed his love for <em>Luna Lovegood</em> in the last movie, this was
                        actually <em>Dean Thomas</em> in the books.
                        <br>
                        Neville got married to <em>Hannah Abbot</em> and was the godfather to Harry Potter's second son
                        <em>Albus Severus Potter</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Neville had no talent for "potions," but he was gifted in "herbology," for which he became a
                        professor when he grew up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even though he was small and not of outstanding cleverness, he was brave to stand up for his
                        friends
                        and himself.
                        <br>
                        This is the reason, the speaking hat placed him at Gryffindor, which as professor, he was the
                        head
                        of house.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Luna Lovegood</li>

                    <li>
                        She saw her mother die when she was nine years old, because she wanted to develop an
                        experimental spell, but unfortunately was killed by it.
                        <br>
                        As a result, she was the only student besides Harry who was able to see thestrals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The actress who played Luna in the films, originally applied to the role of Hermine. <em>J.K.
                            Rowlings</em> promised her a side role, if she overcomes her bulimia, which she did and got
                        the role of Luna.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Luna's Father published Harry's interview in his magazin 'The Quibbler'. This article helped
                        Harry to convince the majority of the wizardry world, that <em>Lord Voldermort</em> has
                        returned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Luna's good friends Harry and Ginny Potter also named their daughter and third child Lily,
                        <em>Luna Potter</em> in honour of her.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the war, Luna became a Magizoologist, discovering and classifying many magical species
                        that had never been encountered before.
                        <br>
                        She eventually married Rolf Scamander, the grandson of <em>Newt Scamander</em>, a famed
                        Magizoologist, with whom she had twin sons, <em>Lorcan</em> and <em>Lysander</em>.

                <li>Dean Thomas</li>

                    <li>
                        Dean's father never told his mother that he was a wizard and was eventually murdered by Death
                        Eaters
                        when he refused to join them, Dean grew up thinking he was Muggle-born.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All of Dean's eight half-sisters were non-magical.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dean was in a loving relation with <em>Ginny Weasley</em>, which married <em>Harry Potter</em>
                        later on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dean's presumed Muggle-born status put him on the run from the <em><a
                        href="../pages/Ministry.html">Ministry of Magic</a></em> of Magic.
                        <br>
                        He went on the run after the <em><a href="../pages/Ministry.html">Ministry of Magic</a></em>
                        fell under the control of <em>Lord Voldemort</em> and began rounding up Muggle-born wizards and
                        witches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dean placed a woolly hat on top of <em>Dobby</em>, to represent that <em>Dobby</em> was a free
                        elf. At the funeral,
                        Dean expressed his thanks to the elf for rescuing them from the Malfoy Manor.
