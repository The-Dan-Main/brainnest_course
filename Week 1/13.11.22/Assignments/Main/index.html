            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I remember as if it were yesterday when our summer vacation was ruined by a strong storm and a deluge of
                rain.
                We were camping by a lake and had to stay in our tent for three days.
                <br>
                My mother unwrapped a tape recorder and a gift that was still wrapped.
                I was five years old at the time and had always been fascinated by magic and stories about magicians.
                <br>
                Inside the gift box was the German version of the audiobook of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
                on
                six cassettes.
                <br>
                We three children were so enthralled by the story that we listened to it directly three times in a row.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I was in love with the world of <strong>Harry Potter</strong> and read every book, watch
                every
                movie and seeked every insight of it.
                <br>
                Years later, I bought all seven audiobooks and still listen to them when I can't sleep or on a rainy
                Sunday
                morning.
                <br>
                My brother and I can reenact all seven audiobooks almost by heart and know details about this magical
                world
                that few know.
                <br><br>
                This year is was able to visit the "Making of Harry Potter - Warner Brother Studios" in Leavesden, UK
                and found a ton of further insights.
                <br>
                As a true fan, I would love to share this knowledge with you and I truly hope you enjoy those hidden
                gems in
                this magical wizardry world!
