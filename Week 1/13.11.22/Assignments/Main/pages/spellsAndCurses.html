                <li>
                    <h4>Expelliarmus</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The disarming Charm, so-called because it would change its object's (the opponent's) quality
                            from armed to disarmed by separating them from their wand.
                            <br>
                            <em>Harry Potter</em> used it again all kinds of enemies, even against 
                            <em>Lord Voldermort</em>, which got his identification spell.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Morsmordre</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Morsmordre was the incantation of a dark charm used to conjure the image of the Dark Mark,
                            the
                            skull-and-serpent sign used by <em>Lord Voldemort</em> and his <em>Death Eaters</em>, in the
                            sky.
                            <br>
                            <em>The Death Eaters</em> cast their mark over the homes of anyone they killed as their
                            calling card. It
                            was said to have been created by <em>Lord Voldemort</em> himself.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Finite Incantatem</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A widely-employed counter-spell used to terminate spell effects in general.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Accio</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight
                            of
                            the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation
                            (unless the spell is casted nonverbally).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Alohomora</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Unlocks doors and other locked objects. It can also unlock doors that have been sealed with
                            a
                            Locking Spell, although it is possible to bewitch doors to become unaffected by this spell.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <h4>Avada Kedavra</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Causes instantaneous death. It is accompanied by a flash of green light and a rushing noise.
                            There is no known Counter-curse that can protect the victim from dying, except for a loving
                            sacrifice. It is one of the three Unforgivable Curses.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Duplicates the target. When used to duplicate objects indefinitely on purpose, is known as
                            the Gemino Curse.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Muffliato</h4>

                        <li>
                            Prevents others from hearing nearby conversations by filling peoples' ears with an
                            unidentifiable buzzing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <li>
                            Used to temporarily bind the victim's body in a position much like that of a soldier at
                            attention; the victim will usually fall to the ground.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Piertotum Locomotor</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In the Battle of <em><a href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em>, <em>Professor
