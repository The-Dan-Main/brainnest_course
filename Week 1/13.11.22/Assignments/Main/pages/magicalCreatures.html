                        <em>Harry Potter</em> was the first person to ever fly with him. He is so strong, that <em>Sirius
                        Black</em>, <em>Hermine Granger</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em> flew with him together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As hippogriffs were immensely proud creatures, Buckbeak was offended when <em>Draco Malfoy</em>
                        taunted and provoked him. This resulted in him injuring the boy's arm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Despite his earlier signs of aggression, Buckbeak has been shown to be very loyal and protective of
                        those who treat him with kindness and respect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During the Battle of <em><a href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em>, <em>Buckbeak</em>,
                        along with several Thestrals, were seen attacking
                        <em>Lord Voldemort's</em> giant soldiers from the air while <em>Grawp</em> was hitting them.
                        <em>Buckbeak</em> survived the battle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buckbeak also defecated in the film version; it happens right after Ron urges Harry to go up to
                        Buckbeak. The CGI team believed this was the first time an animal was animated doing this, but
                        Walking With Dinosaurs did it first in 1999.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the book of <em>Harry Potter</em> and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry doesn't exactly enjoy his
                        first ride
                        on Buckbeak, and it's made clear between hippogriffs and broomsticks which one he prefers. However,
                        in the film adaptation,
                        <br>
                        during his first ride on Buckbeak, Harry appears to be fascinated by the ride and enjoys it
                        immensely as they fly over the Black Lake, raising his arms and shouting in triumph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buckbeak was intelligent in his ability to recognise his past acquaintances, as he defended a
                        cornered Harry from Severus Snape in 1997.[7] His loyalty towards Harry was undying, and further
                        proven when he joined the Battle of <em><a href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em> in 1998
                        to fight.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Dobby - a free elf</li>
                <img src="../images/Dobby.webp" alt="Dobby the elf portrait">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dobby was freed by <em>Harry Potter</em> due to a clever trick, as Harry placed a dirty sock of his
                        in <em>Tom Riddle's</em> Diary, when giving it back to <em>Lucius Malfoy</em>.
                        <br>
                        Lucius then handed the book to Dobby, who took the sock in the book as a gift, which freed him from
                        his tie to the Malfoy family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dobby tried three things to stop Harry from going back/staying in <em><a href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hiding his Mail and dropping a cake on the head of a guests of the Dursleys.</li>
                            <li>Blocking the barrier, when Harry and Ron tried to get on platform 9 3/4.</li>
                            <li>Sending a cursed bludger during a quidditch match after Harry, which broke his arm.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off, but Dobby beat him down.
                        Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, he likes work better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When Hermine tried to free more house-elf's from <em><a
                                href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em>, she started to knit hats and hid them
                        under trash. What she did not knew, is that Dobby collected all the hats for himself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dobby became close friends with <em>Aberforth Dumbledore</em> and spent much time at Aberforth's
                        home in
                        Hogsmeade. Aberforth seemed to have a close attachment to Dobby, since he felt very sorry when he
                        learned he died.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dobby gave Harry the idea, where they could train with <em>Dumbledore's Army</em>. He knew of this
                        secret room, because he had used it frequently to hide Winky after she became drunk from Butterbeer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When <em>Marietta Edgecombe</em> betrayed Dumbledore's Army to <em>Professor Umbridge</em>, Dobby
                        immediately warned
                        Harry that the Inquisitorial Squad was going to attack, even though the house-elves had been
                        forbidden to tell anyone,
                        <br>
                        but he told Harry as he was far more loyal to him than to Umbridge or <em><a
                                href="../pages/locations.html">Hogwarts</a></em> in general and also a
                        free elf that was not forced to obey.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Fawkes - the phoenix</li>
                <img src="../images/fawkes.webp" alt="drawing of fawkes with his yellow and red feathers">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fawkes was a highly intelligent male phoenix and <em>Albus Dumbledore's</em> animal companion and
                        defender.
                        Fawkes had been in Dumbledore's service for 59 years up to the Headmaster's death in 1997.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        His tears (which possessed healing properties, as with his species) saved Harry's life after his arm
                        was punctured by the basilisk's fang and its venom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Harry's and <em>Lord Voldermort's</em> wand have both a core of Fawkes tail-feathers, which ties
                        together
                        their fates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first time, <em>Harry Potter</em> encountered Fawkes on his Burning Day. Fawkes appeared very
                        ill,
                        decrepit and baleful, and much to Harry's initial shock and horror, burst into flames in front of
                        his eyes.
                        <br>
                        When Dumbledore entered, Harry explained to Dumbledore what had just happened to his bird, but
                        Dumbledore calmly explained to Harry that Fawkes was a phoenix and thus was immortal, and that he
                        had been looking "dreadful for days".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During Dumbledore's duel against <em>Lord Voldemort</em> in the <em><a
                                href="../pages/Ministry.html">Ministry of Magic</a></em> Atrium in 1996, Fawkes
                        swallowed a
                        Killing Curse intended for Dumbledore, thus giving Dumbledore time to defend himself against
                        Voldemort's second oncoming attack.
                        <br>
                        He burst into flame upon swallowing the curse and was later reborn from the ashes. He was later
                        returned to Dumbledore's office after <em>Harry Potter</em> was sent there, following his departure
                        from the
                        British <em><a href="../pages/Ministry.html">Ministry of Magic</a></em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fawkes served as <em>Albus Dumbledore's</em> messenger and his constant companion, forming a close
                        bond with
                        the old wizard. Fawkes was also affiliated with <em>Harry Potter</em> and the members of the Order
                        of the
                        Phoenix and was the inspiration for its name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fawkes is named after <em>Guy Fawkes</em>, since he periodically explodes (in order to be reborn
                        from the
                        ashes, like all phoenixes), a joke on the author's part.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The fact that Fawkes, who sacrificed to save Dumbledore's life at the Battle of the Department of
                        Mysteries, didn't come to his aid at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower hints to the true nature of
                        the headmaster's death, meaning he was killed by his own orders.
