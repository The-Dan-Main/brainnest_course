            <h3>Ministry of magic and their departments </h3>
            <p>
                The Minister for Magic was the political leader of the wizarding community in their respective countries
                around the world, and the highest ranking member of the Ministry of Magic, which they controlled.
                <br>
                The position somewhat corresponded to the Prime Minister of Muggles in their respective countries.
                In Great Britain, the Minister was advised on wizarding matters by their staff members and by the other
                Heads of Departments.
                <br>
                They also chaired the Wizengamot to pass Wizarding Laws, or to hear important trials
                (such as Harry Potter's case), though the verdicts were decided by majority vote, including that of the
                Minister themselves.
                <br>
                Many other wizarding countries also had Ministers and had similar governmental systems,
                such as the Bulgarian Minister or the Zaubereiminister of wizarding Germany.
